# EE8603-Bike-Sharing-Dataset-Project-Bara-Rababah
Bike-sharing services are essential components of city transport systems, requiring accurate demand forecasting for effective bike allocation. This project applied machine learning with regression models to analyze the UCI Bike Sharing Dataset and predict daily bike rentals based on environmental and time characteristics. The main objective was to develop predictive models that forecast bike rental demand, optimizing distribution to improve user experience. Data preparation included cleaning, one-hot encoding, and normalization. Exploratory data analysis and feature selection informed model development, which included Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models. Evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² revealed that Random Forest outperformed other models, achieving the highest accuracy and generalizability. This study demonstrates the value of machine learning in enhancing resource allocation and user satisfaction in bike-sharing operations, supporting sustainable urban transportation planning. Future work could explore hybrid and deep learning models to further improve prediction accuracy and scalability.
