# EE8603-Bike-Sharing-Dataset-Project-Bara-Rababah
Bike-sharing services are essential components of city transport systems, requiring accurate demand forecasting for effective bike allocation. This project applies machine learning with regression models to analyze the UCI Bike Sharing Dataset and predict daily bike rentals based on environmental and time characteristics. The main objective is to develop predictive models that forecast bike rental demand, optimizing distribution to improve user experience. Data preprocessing includes one-hot encoding, normalizing continuous variables, and exploratory data analysis. Model selection involves linear regression, decision trees, and random forests, with evaluation using metrics like MAE, RMSE, R-squared, and cross-validation. The anticipated outcome is that random forests will outperform other models due to their ability to handle non-linear relationships, with key factors such as temperature and time of day significantly influencing predictions. This project aims to enhance operational efficiency and user satisfaction for bike-sharing organizations.
